# Technical Specifications

## Platform Architecture - Eight Core Facets

### 1. Autonomous Unit
The fundamental building blocks of communication:

- **Whispers**: Ephemeral, low-intensity communications
- **Emojis**: Non-verbal emotional indicators  
- **Stickers**: Visual meme-based communication
- **Text Blocks**: Structured messages containing:
  - Message/Post structure
    - Subject line
    - Body content
    - Custom fields
- **Metadata Layer**:
  - Spatial addressing:
    - Sender identification
    - Receiver identification
    - Extensions and aliases
  - Reference space:
    - Abstracts
    - Keywords
    - Hashtags
  - Temporal markers:
    - Date stamps
    - Time stamps
    - Channel identifiers
    - Unique message codes

### 2. Critical Functions
Essential operations that enable the system:

- **Send**: Message transmission
- **Receive**: Message reception
- **Read Receipts**: Multi-stage delivery tracking
  - Sent confirmation
  - Delivered status
  - Read notification
- **Attach Media**: File and media integration
- **Block and Filter**: Content control mechanisms
- **Set Aside/Schedule/Remind**: Time management features
- **Conditional Logic**: Context-aware operations
  - Time-based conditions (when/if)
  - Location-based conditions (where/for each)
  - Custom conditional rules

### 3. Supportive Platform
Routing and delivery mechanisms across communication patterns:

#### Communication Routing Matrix
The platform routes messages across three degrees of scale (individual, group, public) and two degrees of scope (short form, long form):

**Short Form Routing:**
- **Individual**: Direct peer-to-peer message routing
- **Group**: Multi-cast routing to defined member sets
- **Public**: Broadcast routing with follower distribution

**Long Form Routing:**
- **Individual**: Store-and-forward email-style routing
- **Group**: Threaded discussion routing with subscription model
- **Public**: Content distribution network for published articles


### 4. Necessary Resources
Data models and structures required for system operation:

- **Social Graph**: Relationship data model mapping user connections
- **Address Book**: Contact data model with identity management
- **Collections**: Thread organization data structures
- **Timeline**: Chronological message data organization
- **Workflows**: Process automation data models and state machines

### 5. Integrative Totality
Holistic system interfaces and unified experiences:

- **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)**: Decentralized data storage and retrieval system supporting all communication modes
- **Unified Timeline Screen**: Integrated view across all communication types
- **Conversation Screens**: Adaptive UI for different communication contexts
- **Settings & Configuration Screen**: System-wide preference management
- **Search & Discovery Interface**: Cross-modal content exploration

### 6. Inherent Values
Core principles embedded in the system:

- **Event History**: Complete chronological record of all communication events
  - Example flow: sent to Chris → sent to Bryan → delivered to Bryan → read by Bryan → delivered to Chris → emoji by Bryan → read by Chris → response by Chris → response by Bryan
- **Thread Tracking**: Management of conversation states
  - Unseen messages
  - Unresponded messages
  - Optional emoji indicators
- **Proximity Detection**: Spatial awareness capabilities

### 7. Intrinsic Nature
Fundamental characteristics of the system:

- **Causal Communication**: Tracking cause-and-effect relationships in message chains
- **Memetic/Stylographic Recognition**: Pattern identification of agents based on:
  - Language usage
  - Communication perspectives
  - Stylistic signatures
- **Availability Management**: Control mechanisms for:
  - Time-based availability
  - Modality-specific permissions
  - Communication boundaries

### 8. Organizational Modes
Structural frameworks for content organization:

#### Spatial Organization
- **Public Spaces**: Open communication channels
  - Twitter-style broadcasting
  - Blog-style publishing
- **Private Spaces**: Restricted communication channels
  - Circle-based groups
  - Direct messaging (DM)

#### Temporal Organization
- **Synchronous**: Real-time communication (Telegram-style)
- **Asynchronous**: Delayed communication (Email-style)

#### Library Systems
- **Address Book**: Contact and identity management
  - Aliases
  - Personas
  - Profiles
- **Media Library**: File storage system
- **Meme Library**: Pattern collection repository
- **Sticker Library**: Visual communication assets

## Future Development

The Memetic Messenger platform represents an intersection of practical communication needs and research objectives. By building a system that both serves user needs and generates analyzable data about communication patterns, we can advance our understanding of how human communication evolves in digital spaces.

The project invites collaboration from researchers, developers, and users interested in exploring the frontiers of digital communication and pattern analysis. Through careful observation and systematic analysis, we may uncover fundamental principles governing the transfer and evolution of communication patterns in our increasingly connected world.
