# Technical Specifications - Complete Design Framework

## Platform Design - Eight Core Facets

### 1. Autonomous Unit
**Atomic building blocks - the irreducible elements that carry meaning**

*The smallest complete unit of communication consisting of content payload, context envelope, and attachment potential.*

**Implementation Components:**
- **Text Fields**:
  - Header (subject, title, group name)
  - Body (content, message)
- **Attach**
- **Metadata**:
  - Time
  - Date
  - Hashtag

### 2. Critical Functions
**Essential verbs - what users can do with communication units**

*Core interaction capabilities: initiate communication, control flow, manage state, and verify delivery.*

**Implementation Features:**
- **Connect**
  - Add / Remove / Block
- **Screener**:
  - Block
  - Allow
- **Compose**
  - New
  - Drafts
- **Send**
  - Schedule
- **Receive**
  - React
  - Mark unread
  - Snooze
- **Reciepts**:
  - Sent
  - Recieved
  - Read / Read by
- **Edit / Update**
- **Forward / Share**
- **Search / Filter**
  - Sender, time, date, tag, attachment, link etc.

### 3. Supportive Platform
**Data infrastructure - the foundational plumbing that enables communication**

*Core data models, routing systems, and technical infrastructure that supports all applications.*

**Control mechanisms** for context aware operations:
  - Communication boundaries and social graph (Who?)
  - Capability manager (Why?)
  - Resource manager (What?)
  - Spatial awareness and proximity detection (Where?)
  - Time-based availability (When?)
  - Conditional logic; workflows and automation (How?)

**Implementation Infrastructure:**
- **Timeline**: Chronological message data organization
- **Collections**: Thread organization data structures
- **Social Graph**: Relationship data model mapping user connections
- **Workflows**: Process automation data models and state machines

Is this the 'weave.social'?

### 4. Necessary Resources
**Applications - the concrete tools users need to accomplish tasks**

*User-facing applications that provide specific functionality within the communication ecosystem.*

**Implementation Applications:**
- **Clock**: Timestamps and scheduling
- **Calendar**: Event planning and temporal organization
- **Identity**: Personal identity and presence management
  - Aliases
  - Personas
  - Profiles
- **Address Book**: Contact management (Humans / Agents)
- **Membrane Manager**: Contextual boundaries: Private, group, public. Social DNA / Cells.
- **Files**: Document and media storage system
    - **Collections**:
      - **Media Library**: Photos and videos
      - **Meme Library**: Viral images
      - **Sticker Library**: Visual communication assets
- **Communication**: Messaging and conversation interfaces
- **Dashboard**: Unified timeline and system overview

### 5. Integrative Totality
**Operating system/ecosystem - the unified environment that ties everything together**

*Meta-layer providing unified experience, cross-app integration, and seamless transitions between all applications.*

**Implementation Environment:**
- **Universal Interface**: Consistent interaction patterns across all applications
- **Cross-App Integration**: Seamless data flow and context sharing between applications
- **Global Search & Discovery**: Cross-modal content exploration across entire ecosystem
- **Unified State Management**: System-wide configuration and synchronization
- **Context Switching**: Smooth transitions between different communication modes and applications
- **System-Wide Notifications**: Coordinated alert and update system across all apps

### 6. Inherent Values
**Philosophical principles embedded in design**

*Core values and principles the system fundamentally believes in and prioritizes.*

**Design Principles:**
- **Provenance**: Every communication event should be traceable and accountable
- **Conversation Continuity**: Communication threads should maintain coherent state and context
- **Contextual Awareness**: The system should understand and respond to spatial, temporal, and social context
- **Cosmic Coherence**: It's not actually about messaging, or computers it's about expanding the scope of causal awareness. 

### 7. Intrinsic Nature
**Emergent qualities - characteristics that arise from system operation**

*Natural system behaviors and capabilities that manifest from the design.*

**Emergent Behaviors:**
- **Composable Communication**: messages, groups, public square, mail, boards and blogs are composed from low level elements.
- **Causal Communication**: Cause-and-effect relationships become trackable through relationships in a DAG.
- **Ordered historical record of events**: Complete chronological record of all communication events naturally emerges
  - Example flow: sent to Chris → sent to Bryan → delivered to Bryan → read by Bryan → delivered to Chris → emoji by Bryan → read by Chris → response by Chris → response by Bryan.
- **Memetic/Stylographic Recognition**: Pattern identification of agents naturally develops based on:
  - Language usage
  - Communication perspectives
  - Stylographic/Memetic signatures

### 8. Organizational Modes
**Taxonomic frameworks - how information gets categorized and accessed**

*Communication scope frameworks defining scale dimensions, temporal dimensions, routing patterns, and context boundaries.*

**Implementation Patterns:**
Communication frameworks across three degrees of scale and two degrees of scope:

**Scale Dimensions:**
- **Individual**: Direct one-to-one communication patterns
- **Group**: Defined member set communication patterns
- **Public**: Open broadcast communication patterns

**Scope Dimensions:**
- **Short Form**: Ephemeral, immediate communication contexts
- **Long Form**: Persistent, threaded communication contexts


## Future Development

The Memetic Messenger platform represents an intersection of practical communication needs and research objectives. By building a system that both serves user needs and generates analyzable data about communication patterns, we can advance our understanding of how human communication evolves in digital spaces.
