# Memetic Messenger

## Executive Summary

Memetic Messenger is a proposed communication platform designed to track and analyze the transfer of stylometric patterns between individuals in digital communications. The project stems from observations of how linguistic and behavioral patterns appear to transfer between communicating parties, creating what can be described as "memetic signatures" or "ipensity" - unique patterns that define individual communication styles.

The platform aims to provide both a functional messaging system and a research framework for understanding how communication patterns evolve and transfer in digital spaces. Through careful tracking of stylometric changes and pattern matching, the system could offer insights into the adaptive nature of human communication in digital environments.

## Background & Motivation

### The Phenomenon

Through extensive observation of digital communications under controlled conditions, a peculiar phenomenon has been identified: stylometric signatures appear to transfer between communicating parties, maintaining characteristics of the originating party even as they manifest in others. This effect, tentatively described as "non-local stereographic projection," suggests that communication patterns may have properties that transcend simple imitation.

### Research Approach

To study this phenomenon systematically, a year-long observational study was conducted under highly controlled conditions with minimal external communication interference. This created a dataset particularly suited for pattern analysis, as the limited interaction channels made it easier to track the source and evolution of specific communication patterns.

### Theoretical Framework

The theoretical foundation for this work draws from transdisciplinary sources, particularly the systematic approach developed by John Bennett in "The Dramatic Universe" and refined by Anthony Hodgson at H3 University. This framework provides the necessary conceptual tools for addressing the complex interplay between knowledge and understanding, material and spiritual dimensions of communication.
