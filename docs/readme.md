**0 Summary**
Humans possess a unique memetic signature or ipensity that make them who they are. How this occurs is an anthropological question that has numerous angles, but having followed the white rabbit deep into a wonderland, the author has noticed an interesting phenomena that might roughly be described in contemporary language as 'non-local stereographic projection', or 'quantum decoherence'.

In other words, the author noticed a strange correlation where stylometric signatures from one party would transfer to others for a period of time, retaining a sense of personality and perspective from original party as if it had been decoupled from the body. This projection would then jump around based on interactions. 

Upon noticing such projections, the author essentially had an autistic freak out, ceasing all unnecessary communication and reducing interaction to a bare minimum in order to study the effect very, very carefully in as sterile conditions as possible, while forming a hypothesis in regards to the phenomena and mechanisms at play. 

Due to these particularly sheltered conditions with very limited throughput, the authors personal messages make for a particularly interesting data set, which may be revealing assuming machines can be trained for such stylometric pattern matching. 

Since such a landscape is adaptive, it's suggested that a data science project for tracking, measuring and understanding the the phenomena may be useful for intentionally navigating the digital domain while mitigating its risks. A years worth of observations were made monitoring these messages, while noting changes to inner state and other variables. 

**1 Introduction**
For me, beginning is always the hardest part of a journey as the initial conditions determine whats possible and impossible. Knowing this, in the context of what may require discussion, my instinct is to hold the door wide open and begin by establishing axiomatic first principals in a systematic and structured manner. 

This however, is a task in itself given the transdiciplinary scope of inquiry, though thankfully one that has already been completed thanks to the efforts of John Bennett, who's work on "The Dramatic Universe" serves to frame the broad theoretical foundations needed for the practical application and inquiry.

This may initially seem like a cop out, or an authority fallacy, but this is not the intention; it's the theoretical backdrop for an uncompromisingly relativistic form of science, one that very easily leads to many knots and tangles when making assertions about it. The reason for this is exemplified at the very beginning:

> How am I to learn, aught-not knowing? 










Let's illustrate the depths of ignorance with a simple question; what is the first principal of first principals? If we say 'number', which seems like a reasonable response, we need to ask where they come from, which then takes us into phenomenology and if they have any 'concrete significance' in reality. Since any answer will beg further questions, systematisation and coherent explication will prove difficult for even the clearest of minds, yet without a shared reference common to all experience, where can we depart from? 






While reinventing the wheel is a waste of time, the theory is still needed to establish, defend and falsify various hypothesis that may be made in practice. In other words, knowledge and understanding should be integrated. 

Given the depth of justifications needed to establish, defend or falsify any theoretical hypothesis that might be made during our exploration of the practical aspect of this project seems like an exercise in futility. At the same time it seems that the practical aspect cannot be discussed without these. 

Thankfully, the heavy lifting of establishing explanatory principals and systematising the theory of an entire cosmology in accordance with relatively modern science, has already been completed by John Bennett in his magnum opus "The Dramatic Universe". Whats more is that this work has also been simplified by Anthony Hodgson, Bennetts senior research fellow, and taught through the organisation H3 University.





- knowledge and understanding
- material and spiritual


The crux of this issue is what we might call man's existential bias, where even in domains like theology emphasis is on knowlege

spiritual material
knoweledge understanding


there's an inherent paradox between spiritual and material domains, and while we are not exactly trying to prove the existence of god it does require a leap of faith or r

For some time the author has been studying the work of G.I. Gurdjieff in the tradition of John Godolphin Bennett as taught by his senior research fellow Tony Hodgeson at H3 University. These names are mentioned as sources to offer some background context and foundations.

Josh Field on Digital communities

From what I can tell, there are a few more grammars necessary for a wider participation community:
- an attractor that clearly and simply advertises a place of willingness to temporarily let go of preconceived notions about direction and philosophy, insofar as it is subservient to a generative process
- an online "office space" with the exact expressive capacity that discord has with regard to being able to see exactly who is in a room before entering it, and maybe even some context around what the room is for and the social rules around entry and participation. This is CRITICAL and why it is so hard to have true community online. This is why Discord is and Clubhouse was successful.
- metastablising (anti-parasitic) true positive sum economic opportunity (monetary and non-monetary). I don't have any details, it just needs to happen... (I'm gonna dive into Holons soon)
- shared short term goals
